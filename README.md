Clearing-Windows-AppData
========================

Using this Windows Store app sample, you can do the following in your app:

 - Create a custom flyout to view and manage all application data containers - local, roaming, temporary, local cache, local settings and roaming settings.
 - Add the custom flyout to the SettingsPane of your app at runtime.
 - Restrict the display of this settings pane to only show up when your app runs in DEBUG mode.
 - Add test data to all application data containers.
 - Get a link to the location of each application data container.
 - Clear any of the application data containers.

The following image shows the app in action, with the custom flyout expanded on the right-hand side.
